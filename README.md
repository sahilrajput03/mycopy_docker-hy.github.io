## ~Sahil: In order to simply deploy it successfully you must configure circleci's environment variable for the project for 

1. DOCKER_LOGIN
2. DOCKER_PASSWORD
   
   - You supposed to enter your docker username as DOCKER_LOGIN and docker password for DOCKER_PASSWORD
   - WARN: Your git repository must have lowercase name otherwise CircleCi will throw error that your repo name must be lowercase!
