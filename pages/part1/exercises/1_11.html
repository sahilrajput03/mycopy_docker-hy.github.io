  Clone, fork or download a project from
  [https://github.com/docker-hy/backend-example-docker](https://github.com/docker-hy/backend-example-docker).

  Create a Dockerfile for the project and give a command so that the project runs in a docker container with port 8000
  exposed and published so when you start the container and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
  you will generate a message in logs.txt in the working directory.

  Create a volume for the logs.txt so that when the application is shut down the logs are not destroyed. And when
  restarted it continues to write into the same logs.txt.

  Submit the Dockerfile and the command used.

  *Do not alter the code of the project*
