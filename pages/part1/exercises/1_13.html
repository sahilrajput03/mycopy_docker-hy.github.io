  Lets create a Dockerfile for a Java Spring project: [github page](https://github.com/docker-hy/spring-example-project)

  The setup should be straightforward with the README instructions. Tips to get you started:

  Use [openjdk image](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk) `FROM openjdk:_tag_` to get java instead of installing it
  manually. Pick the tag by using the README and dockerhub page.

  You've completed the exercise when you see a 'Success' message in your browser.
