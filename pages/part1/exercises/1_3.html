  <h1>1.3 Hello Docker Hub</h1>

  Start image `devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise` with flags `-it` like so: `docker run -it devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise`.
  It will wait for your input. Navigate through docker hub to find the docs and Dockerfile that was used to create the
  image.

  Read the Dockerfile and/or docs to learn what input will get the application to answer a "secret message".

  Submit the secret message and command(s) given to get it as your answer.
