  Now that we've warmed up it's time to get inside a container while it's running!

  Start image `devopsdockeruh/exec_bash_exercise`, it will start a container with clock-like features and create a
  log. Go inside the container and use `tail -f ./logs.txt` to follow the logs. Every 15 seconds the clock will send
  you a "secret message".

  Submit the secret message and command(s) given as your answer.
