  *Exercises in part 2 should be done using docker-compose*

  Container of `devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise` will create logs into its `/usr/app/logs.txt`.

  Create a docker-compose.yml file that starts `devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise` and saves the logs into your
  filesystem.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml, make sure that it works simply by running `docker-compose up` if the log file exists.
