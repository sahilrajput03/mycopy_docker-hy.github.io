  Some buttons may have stopped working in the frontend + backend project. Make sure that every button for exercises
  works.

  This may need a peek into the browsers developer consoles again like back part 1. The buttons of nginx exercise and

  If you had to do any changes explain what you had to change.

  Submit the docker-compose yml and both dockerfiles.
