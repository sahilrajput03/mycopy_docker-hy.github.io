  <h1>2.3</h1>

  As we saw previously, starting an application with two programs was not trivial and the commands got a bit long.

  Since we already created working Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend we can go step further and simplify the
  usage into one docker-compose.yml.

  Configure the backend and frontend from part 1 to work in docker-compose.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml
