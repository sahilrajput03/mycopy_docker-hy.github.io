  Add redis to example backend.

  Redis is used to speed up some operations. Backend uses a slow api to get information. You can test the slow api by
  requesting `/slow` with curl. The frontend program has a button to test this. Before configuring redis it should take
  10 to 20 seconds to get a response.

  Configure a redis container to cache information for the backend. Use the documentation if needed when configuring:
  [https://hub.docker.com/\_/redis/](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/)

  The backend [README](https://github.com/docker-hy/backend-example-docker) should have all the information needed to
  connect.

  When you've correctly configured it should take less than a second to get a response and the button will turn green.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml
