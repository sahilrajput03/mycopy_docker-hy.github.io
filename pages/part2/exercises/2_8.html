  <h1>2.8</h1>

  Add nginx to example frontend + backend.

  <img src="{{ "/images/exercises/back-front-redis-database-and-nginx.png" | absolute_url }}" />

  Accessing your service from arbitrary port is counter intuitive since browsers use 80 (http) and 443 (https) by
  default. And having the service refer to two origins in a case where there's only one backend isn't desirable either.
  We will skip the SSL setup for https/443.

  Nginx will function as a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) for us (see the image above).
  The requests arriving at anything other than /api will be redirected to frontend container and /api will get
  redirected to backend container.

  At the end you should see that the frontend is accessible simply by going to http://localhost and the button works.
  Other buttons may have stopped working, do not worry about them.

  As we will not start configuring reverse proxies on this course you can have a simple config file:

  The following file should be set to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf inside the nginx container. You can use a file volume where
  the contents of the file are the following:

  ```
  events { worker_connections 1024; }

  http {
    server {
      listen 80;

      location / {
        proxy_pass _frontend-connection-url_;
      }

      location /api/ {
        proxy_pass _backend-connection-url_;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Note that again inside the docker-compose network the connecting urls are usually form "http://hostname:port" where
  hostname and port are both known only inside the network.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml

  > **Nginx specific information** on why the api might not be found with your url:
  <br /> Without a trailing `/` in
  proxy_pass url nginx will preserve `location` in your url.
  <br /> If you have `/` as the final symbol of the url nginx
  will omit the `location`.
  <br /> So with `location /api/` if you send a request to .../api/ping the request will be
  proxied to .../api/ping when proxy_pass ends in `;` (no `/`). And to .../ping if it ends with `/;` The backend won't
  answer from /api/ping but will answer from /ping.
