  <h1>3.1</h1>

  Return back to our [frontend](https://github.com/docker-hy/frontend-example-docker) &
  [backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/backend-example-docker) Dockerfiles and you should see the some mistakes we now
  know to fix.

  Document both image sizes at this point, as was done in the material. Optimize the Dockerfiles of both programs,
  frontend and backend, by joining the RUN commands and removing useless parts.

  After your improvements document the image sizes again. The size difference may not be very much yet. The frontend
  should be around 432MB when using `FROM ubuntu:16.04`. The backend should be around 351MB. The sizes may vary.
