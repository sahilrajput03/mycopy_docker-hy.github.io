  <h1>3.6</h1>

  Multi-stage builds. Lets do a multi-stage build for the
  [frontend](https://github.com/docker-hy/frontend-example-docker) project since we've come so far with the application.

  Even though multi-stage builds are designed mostly for binaries in mind, we can leverage the benefits with our
  frontend project as having original source code with the final assets makes little sense. Build it with the
  instructions in README and the built assets should be in `dist` folder.

  You can still use the `serve` to serve the static files or try out something else.
